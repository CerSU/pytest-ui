Text User Interface for running python tests.

# main goals
The goal of this project is to ease the testing process by
  - [x] selecting tests to run using fuzzy filter
  - [x] viewing failed tests stacktrace/output/log while the test suite is still running
  - [x] rerunning failed tests
  - [ ] running a test with debugger
  - [ ] usage as pytest plugin (for custom pytest scripts)
